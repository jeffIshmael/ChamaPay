# ChamaPay

![ChamaPay Logo](logo-no-background.png)

ChamaPay is a decentralized platform that leverages the **cKES stablecoin** to facilitate the traditional _chama_ system of rotary giving. Users can create and manage public or private chamas where members contribute funds that are distributed to participants in rotating turns. By integrating blockchain technology, ChamaPay ensures transparent, secure, and efficient fund management for these savings groups.

## Overview

ChamaPay aims to bring the traditional _chama_ model into the digital world using the power of blockchain. It allows users to form groups where members take turns receiving funds from a shared pool. By leveraging the cKES stablecoin, ChamaPay ensures the stability of funds, and smart contracts manage the contribution and disbursement process, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## Features

- **Create Public and Private Chamas:**  
  Users can create two types of chamas: public (open to anyone) and private (by invitation only).
- **Rotary Fund Disbursement:**  
  Funds are contributed and distributed to chama members in turns, managed by smart contracts.

- **Hybrid Payment Options:**  
  Supports payments with cKES stablecoin and integration with mobile money systems like M-Pesa (future plans).

- **Smart Contract-based Transparency:**  
  All transactions and fund rotations are handled transparently on the blockchain.

- **Secure and Private:**  
  User data is protected, and blockchain ensures that funds are safe and disbursed according to pre-set rules.

## Inspiration

ChamaPay was inspired by the need to digitize communal saving systems like _chamas_, which have been used for generations to build financial security within communities. By using blockchain, we aim to bring more transparency, security, and efficiency to the process while ensuring that anyone can participate without geographical restrictions.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Chama:**  
   Users can create a chama by defining parameters like group type (public or private), number of members, contribution amount, and rotation schedule.
2. **Invite Members:**  
   In private chamas, the group creator can invite specific people, while public chamas are open for anyone to join.

3. **Contribute Funds:**  
   Members contribute a fixed amount of funds in **cKES**, which are pooled together.

4. **Rotary Disbursement:**  
   Funds are distributed to each member in turns.

5. **Withdrawal:**  
   Members can claim their funds when it’s their turn, and the smart contract ensures they receive the correct amount.
